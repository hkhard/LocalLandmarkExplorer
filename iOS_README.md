# iOS Development Setup

This project contains a basic Swift file (`HelloWorld.swift`) as a starting point for iOS development. However, please note that full iOS development cannot be done directly on Replit. Here's what you need for actual iOS development:

1. **Mac Computer**: iOS development requires a Mac running macOS.

2. **Xcode**: Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for building iOS apps. You can download it from the Mac App Store or Apple's developer website.

3. **Apple Developer Account**: While you can develop and test on simulators for free, you'll need an Apple Developer account to test on physical devices and publish to the App Store.

## Next Steps

1. Install Xcode on your Mac.
2. Open `HelloWorld.swift` in Xcode.
3. Create a new iOS project in Xcode and integrate this file.
4. Build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.

## Resources for iOS Development

- [Apple's Swift Resources](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/)
- [iOS App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training)
- [Stanford CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/)

Remember, while you can write Swift code on Replit, you'll need to transfer it to a Mac with Xcode for full iOS development capabilities.
